# Communication-Device
Basic HTML code for a Communication Device for children.
This communication device is comprised of a Home Screen with nine buttons.
The Yes and No buttons lead to just a Yes or No screen.
The other seven buttons open menus with nine more buttons.
Each sub-screen has nine more buttons. Eight are simple phrases and one acts as a back button.

The code is very simple but can be easily modified to fit user needs.
